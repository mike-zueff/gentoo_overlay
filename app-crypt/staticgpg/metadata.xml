    GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does
    not use the patented IDEA algorithm, it can be used without any
    restrictions. GnuPG is a RFC2440 (OpenPGP) compliant application.
    This variant is compiled statically, and is only intended for use
    within an initramfs. It does not rely on the pinenetry helper.
